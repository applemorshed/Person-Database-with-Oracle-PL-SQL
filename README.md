# Person-Database-with-Oracle-PL-SQL
My oracle sql final project file. Code is written in PL/SQL.
Designed and implemented an Oracle database to store country citizenship data. Used stored procedures, functions and views to store and retrieve data for reporting. 

The main idea is to create a central database where we can store each individual’s
information, such as last name, first name, birth date, SSN, address, phone number, job information, car information, physical description, bank information, education information, family relationship and so on.
Practical use of this data base is huge. This data base store each individual information. If someone report any suspicious car license plate number, immediately police can find the owners of the car. If police receive an emergency call (911), police can identify the person.
This data set has relational information of a person. It is possible to find all the family member of a person.
If someone want to open a bank account, bank can collect all the necessary information from the central database and open a bank account within a minute.
If Government wants to send information to the people in a area, they can send Email or SMS only that particular area’s people. Fx: Emergency power outrage, water work, Construction work etc.
